We don’t stick to\n                    the status quo and want to create a community of young\n                    people who are conscious that there’s got to be more to\n                    life. If we have so many comforts and conveniences, why do\n                    we often find ourselves feeling dissatisfied, empty and\n                    lacking in purpose?\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    Feeding our spiritual sides and taking you on a journey of\n                    self-realisation is a big part of the KCSoc mission. As you\n                    gain a deeper sense of who you are and make lifelong friends\n                    with like-minded people, you’ll soon find a greater vision\n                    for your life unfolding that you wouldn’t have been able to\n                    tap into otherwise. We’ve seen countless young people\n                    completely transform after joining KCSoc over the years and\n                    now they’re our there in the big wide world contributing to\n                    society in massive and previously unthinkable ways.\n                </p>\n            </Fade>\n            <Fade>\n                <div>\n                    <h1>Inspiration</h1>\n                    <h2>A.C.

The journey was\n                        treacherous, and the elderly spiritual teacher suffered\n                        two heart attacks aboard the ship. Arriving in the\n                        United States with just 7 dollars in Indian rupees and\n                        his translations of sacred Sanskrit texts, he began to\n                        spread the teachings of Krishna Consciousness. His\n                        spiritual message resonated with many young people, some\n                        of whom came forward to become serious students of the\n                        Krishna tradition. With the help of these students,\n                        Srila Prabhupada rented a small storefront on New York’s\n                        Lower East Side to use as a temple. On July 11, 1966, he\n                        officially registered his organization in the state of\n                        New York, formally founding the International Society\n                        for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON).\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                        In the 11 years that followed, Srila Prabhupada circled\n                        the globe 14 times on lecture tours, bringing the\n                        teachings of Lord Krishna to thousands of people on 6\n                        continents. Men and women from all backgrounds and walks\n                        of life came forward to accept his message, and with\n                        their help, Srila Prabhupada established ISKCON centers\n                        and projects throughout the world. Under his\n                        inspiration, ISCKON established temples, rural\n                        communities, and educational institutions and started\n                        what would become the world’s largest vegetarian food\n                        relief program. With the desire to nourish the roots of\n                        Krishna Consciousness in its home, Srila Prabhupada\n                        returned to India several times, where he sparked a\n                        revival of the ancient tradition. In India, he opened\n                        dozens of temples, including large centers in the\n                        auspicious towns of Vrindavana and Mayapur.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                        Srila Prabhupada’s most significant contributions,\n                        perhaps, are his books. He authored over 70 volumes on\n                        the Krishna philosophy, which are highly respected by\n                        scholars for their authority, depth and fidelity to the\n                        tradition. Several of his works are used as textbooks in\n                        university courses and his writings have been translated\n                        into 76 languages. His most prominent works include:\n                        Bhagavad-gita As It Is, the multi-volume\n                        Srimad-Bhagavatam and the set of Sri\n                        Caitanya-Caritamrita books.\n                    </p>\n                </div>\n            </Fade>\n        </FadeIn>\n    )\n}\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
