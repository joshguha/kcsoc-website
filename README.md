  Welcome to the KCSoc website repository
</h1>

KCSoc is creating a new and improved website using React, Gatsby and GraphQL. We are also going to create an accompanying mobile app which will synchronise with the website. 

## Task for Krupa: Styling the website

Styling the website will require knowledge of the following: 

* Git and Github (this allows us to easily collaborate on the same code)
* CSS (the bread and butter for styling websites)
* Flexbox (Advanced CSS)
* SCSS and SASS (CSS Preprocessors for making life a little easier)
* CSS Modules (for modularising CSS)

When you are ready to start coding download the following:

* [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
_This is a platform for writing your code_
* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
_For running javascript_

Next create a Github account and let me know what your username is. I'll add you onto this repository (repo) as a collaborator.

Clone this repo onto your machine and then open with VSCode.

Open the in-built terminal in VSCode, and type the following command:

```
npm i -g gatsby-cli
```
then
```
npm i 
```
and finally
```
gatsby develop
```
Finally, open your browser onto http://localhost:8000 and you should be able to view the website running in developer mode. 

You can then create a new git branch and work on the styles. When you're done, I can merge the branch onto the master branch.
