# Introduction to the README Template

Hare Krishna! Welcome to the PS README template. Please fill out this template on how your project is/was developed and deployed to create documentation. The storage of information in one place is very useful and also ensures all the information is present for the future.

Please keep this template structure and do not remove any sections. Feel free to add subsections under the existing headings. If any sections do not apply, please leave them intact, for future use. Do not hesitate to contact the current maintainer (<dhaval@soneji.xyz>) if you have any questions or queries. Please also feel free to submit a Pull Request to improve this template.

This template should be used to create the `README.md` file in your project repository. The file properly starts below! ‚¨áÔ∏è

Please use [gh-md-toc](https://github.com/ekalinin/github-markdown-toc) to create and update your table of contents. Make sure you leave the `ts` and `te` comments above as that's what `gh-md-toc` uses to generate the table of contents

  Welcome to the KCSoc website repository
</h1>

KCSoc is creating a new and improved website using React, Gatsby and GraphQL. We are also going to create an accompanying mobile app which will synchronise with the website. 

## Task for Krupa: Styling the website

Styling the website will require knowledge of the following: 

* Git and Github (this allows us to easily collaborate on the same code)
* CSS (the bread and butter for styling websites)
* Flexbox (Advanced CSS)
* SCSS and SASS (CSS Preprocessors for making life a little easier)
* CSS Modules (for modularising CSS)

When you are ready to start coding download the following:

* [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
_This is a platform for writing your code_
* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
_For running javascript_

Next create a Github account and let me know what your username is. I'll add you onto this repository (repo) as a collaborator.

Clone this repo onto your machine and then open with VSCode.

Open the in-built terminal in VSCode, and type the following command:

```
npm i -g gatsby-cli
```
then
```
npm i 
```
and finally
```
gatsby develop
```
Finally, open your browser onto http://localhost:8000 and you should be able to view the website running in developer mode. 

You can then create a new git branch and work on the styles. When you're done, I can merge the branch onto the master branch.
