  Welcome to the KCSoc website repository

KCSoc is creating a new and improved website using React, Gatsby and GraphQL. We are also going to create an accompanying mobile app which will synchronise with the website.

## Task for Krupa: Styling the website

Styling the website will require knowledge of the following: 

* Git and Github (this allows us to easily collaborate on the same code)
* CSS (the bread and butter for styling websites)
* Flexbox (Advanced CSS)
* SCSS and SASS (CSS Preprocessors for making life a little easier)
* CSS Modules (for modularising CSS)

When you are ready to start coding download the following:

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
_This is a platform for writing your code_
[Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
_For running javascript_






Kick off your project with this hello-world boilerplate. This starter ships with the main Gatsby configuration files you might need to get up and running blazing fast with the blazing fast app generator for React.
