His\n                                    spiritual message resonated with many young\n                                    people, some of whom came forward to become\n                                    serious students of the Krishna tradition.\n                                    With the help of these students, Srila\n                                    Prabhupada rented a small storefront on New\n                                    York’s Lower East Side to use as a temple.\n                                    On July 11, 1966, he officially registered\n                                    his organization in the state of New York,\n                                    formally founding the International Society\n                                    for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON).\n                                </p>\n                                <p>\n                                    In the 11 years that followed, Srila\n                                    Prabhupada circled the globe 14 times on\n                                    lecture tours, bringing the teachings of\n                                    Lord Krishna to thousands of people on 6\n                                    continents.

Under his\n                                    inspiration, ISCKON established temples,\n                                    rural communities, and educational\n                                    institutions and started what would become\n                                    the world’s largest vegetarian food relief\n                                    program.
